NPV function needs some fix. You are using the cash flow discounting.
Because bond's yield to maturity is fixed, there is a fixed formula from bond's valuation to YTM.

# isolate(values$r <- exp(input$YTM*0.01*values$d/12))
# isolate(values$NPV[1] <- sum(values$CF/values$r))

YY> isolate(values$x<- 1/(1+input$YTM*.01*input$coupon_freq/12)^(values$n))
YY> isolate(values$NPV[1]<-input$coupon_rate*0.01*input$coupon_freq/12*input$FV*(1-values$x)/(input$YTM*.01*input$coupon_freq/12)+input$FV*values$x)

Assignment 3 = 100 * 0.05 + 100 * 0.25 + 90 * 0.7
Part 1: 100

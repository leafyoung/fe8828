Hi, Bryan

Below is the assignment feedback. You did well in the course.

Regards,
Yang Ye

Assignment 1 = 100

Assignment 2 = 100 * 0.3 + 100 * 0.7
Part 1: 100
Part 2: 100

Assignment 3 = 0 * 0.05 + 75 * 0.25 + 90 * 0.7
Part 1: 0 (missed a little assignment of calculating option value over a portfolio of options)
Part 2: 80 (source data file is not provided, volatility surface didn't draw for OTM options only)
Part 3: 90 (Good. A ballad of default)

Assignment 4 = 80
* Repetitive the theme of default.
* Plots can be refined.

For example,

#Finding 5 
The mean, maximum and minimum age of the default cases are:

default_age <- filter(select(bank, default,age), default == "yes")
mean_age <- summarize(group_by(default_age, default), age = mean(age))
max_age <- summarize(group_by(default_age, default), age = max(age))
min_age <- summarize(group_by(default_age, default), age = min(age))
# ggplot(bank, aes(age, default)) + geom_point()
YY> ggplot(default_age, aes(age, default)) + geom_point() +
YY>   geom_point(data = mean_age, color = 'blue', size = 5, alpha = 0.3) +
YY>   geom_point(data = max_age, color = 'green', size = 5, alpha = 0.3) +
YY>   geom_point(data = min_age, color = 'red', size = 5, alpha = 0.3)

Hi, Jia Yuan

Well done! The multiplication table is dedicated designed.

I found two places to be improved.

1/ Bond pricer: 0.5 has been hard-coded as the interval. Better let it = 1 / Frequency.
2/ MC pricer: the result from MC pricer should be close to closed-form formula, which is B13.

At first glance, I found that you have missed sigma^2.

Yours: =B2*EXP(($B$8-0.5*$B$5)*$B$16+$B$5*B21*SQRT($B$16))
Correct: =B2*EXP(($B$8-0.5*$B$5*$B$5)*$B$16+$B$5*B21*SQRT($B$16))

You can correct this first and see whether your result is better.

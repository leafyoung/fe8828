Hi, Liu Zhe

Below is your assignment feedback. You did very good in the course.

Regards,
Yang Ye

Assignment 1 = 80
a bit rough

Assignment 2 = 100 * 0.3 + 70 * 0.7
Part 1: 100

Part 2: 70
# Coupon rate should be divided by coupon frequency. 

  #function to calculate NPV value
  NPVGenerator <- function(C, Y, freq, N){
    if (freq == "Annual"){f=1}
    if (freq == "Semiannual"){f=2}
    if (freq == "Quarterly"){f=4}
    n <- f*N
    y <- (Y/f)/100
    # C*(1-1/(1+y)^n)/y+(100/(1+y)^n)
    (C/f)*(1-1/(1+y)^n)/y+(100/(1+y)^n)
  }

Assignment 3: = 0 * 0.05 + 80 * 0.25 + 110 * 0.7
Part 1: 0 (missed a little assignment of calculating option value over a portfolio of options)
Part 2: 80 (Volatility is as high as 400%. Time should be annualized.)

# mutate(Volat = GBSVolatility(Price, tolower(substring(CallPut,1,1)),as.numeric(StockPrice), as.numeric(Strike),
# (as.numeric(Expiration) - as.numeric(Date)), 0.01, 0)) 

YY> mutate(Volat = GBSVolatility(Price, tolower(substring(CallPut,1,1)),as.numeric(StockPrice), as.numeric(Strike),
YY> (as.numeric(Expiration) - as.numeric(Date)) / 365, 0.01, 0)) 

Part 3: 90 + 10
+10: age_group and neg balance are key targets of your analysis.
Always join on the side of the unfiltered group so you don't lose a group.

AgeGrpNumber is a un-filtered group.

AgeGrpTable <- mutate(bank, AgeGroup = (age %/% 10) * 10)
AgeGrpNumber <- group_by(AgeGrpTable, AgeGroup) %>% summarize(TotalNumber=n())

# left_join(UnemployedNumber, AgeGrpNumber, by = "AgeGroup")
YY> right_join(UnemployedNumber, AgeGrpNumber, by = "AgeGroup")

Assignment 4: = 90 + 10
My best: Finding #5
+10: It's very pleasant to read the summary.
90: some conclusions are contrary to the result.

Quote you

    # Finding #10
    Also, after “retired” people are taken out from the “No Job” group, the “No Job” group average bank account balance has a significant fall of $200,
    and becomes lower than that of Employed people.

However, figure reads that employed's mean balance is 1358 and unemployed (excluding retired) is 1545.

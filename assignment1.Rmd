## R Markdown

What's normal distribution?


```{r}
sample_norm <- rpois(1000, 3)
# hist(sample_norm)
plot(sample_norm)

# chunk

```

## Random number

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Assignment 2
  Well-done. But I have two points
  1/ Missing zero-split_num case.
  2/ Lack of writing in Rmd.

## Option Evaluation

1/ # YY: This is check is not necessary.
# When option is in the money/out-of-money, buyer may choose to sell it to option dealer to settle it earlier.
# This is still Open interest.
# Simply:
sum(df$`| Open Interest`)

2/ Correct code should be below

df4 <- mutate(df3, price=(`| Bid`+`| Ask`)/2)
# as.numeric((as.Date("2018-12-14") - as.Date("2018-11-14")))/365 = 0.08219178
df5 <- group_by(df4, `| Strike`) %>% 
  dplyr::filter((`| Call/Put` == "c" & `| Strike` >= `| Underlying`) | (`| Call/Put` == "p" & `| Strike` <= `| Underlying`)) %>% 
  rowwise() %>%
  # YY: misplaced Underlying and Strike
  mutate(vol=GBSVolatility(price, `| Call/Put`, `| Underlying`, `| Strike`, 0.08219178, r = 0.03, b = 0))

plot(df5$`| Strike`,df5$vol)

## EDA
#10 is good. #9 needs some tweak.

#9
# YY: Normalize the data
Original: df9 <- group_by(bank, campaign) %>% summarise(yes=sum(y=="yes"))
YY:       df9 <- group_by(bank, campaign) %>% summarise(yes=sum(y=="yes")/n())

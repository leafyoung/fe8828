Good. I just found one point in your code.

    make_choice<-function(N, split_number){
      input_list <- sample(1:N, N, replace=FALSE)
      best_n <- max(input_list[1:split_number])
      
      # YY: Add code to handle if split_number == 0 case.
      
      for(i in (split_number+1):N){
        in_n <- input_list[i]
        if(in_n>best_n){
          best_n <- in_n
          break;
        }
        
        if(i==N) #counting how many times the best prince is picked for the probability
          best_n <- input_list[N]
      }
      return(best_n) 
    }

Finding #4 needs normalized by /n(), which is how many people in that job.

Your "option_value" is a special case that the portfolio has to be sold with final payoff, which is a big discount. Time value of the option has been waived.\

# Assignment 1:
You are among the top. Excellent content and good choice of color and pictures. The Go button is good. Good effort!

# Assignment 2:
Well-done. I have a few points:
0. Both zero-split-number and not-found case are handled. Good!
1. It's better to organize your codes into functions. Function contatins a smaller and focused chunk of logic; and they can be parameterized to run with different inputs.
2. N = 5000 would get a closer answer 37. N = 10000 would be 39. Try a bit more than 1000, in one word.

# Assignment 3
For option Volatility, you may use mutate(rowwise(df), vol = GBSVolatility(...)). GBSVolatility function will be called once for each row.

Your EDA is good. #7 - #10 have a focus on call duration. You have a depth; in comparison, other good assignments have more coverage. You have earned your merit.

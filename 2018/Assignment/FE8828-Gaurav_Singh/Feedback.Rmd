Good. I liked your document and additional approximation line.

But... but sadly, you missed two important logic in the make_choice()

    if(split_number==0) {
      # YY: This would not work for the zero-split-number case.
      # YY: Because loop below only stops when selected_n < current_best
      
      current_best<-selection[1]
    } else    {
      current_best<-min(evaluation)
    }
    
    # YY: You also don't have the 2nd logic to handle that if N in the first group, then the princes will choose the last one in the queue.
    # YY: These two reasons could contribute to why your result looks high. It would be around 37.
    for(i in 1:(N-split_number))
    {
      selected_n<-selection[i]
      if(selected_n < current_best)
      {
        current_best<-selected_n
        break
      }	
    }

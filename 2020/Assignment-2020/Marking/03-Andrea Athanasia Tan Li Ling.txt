A1: Shiny Web

- Nice

A2.1 Secretary

Following line is not right. With a split_number = 10, it returns 0:9 from 1:split_number-1 and first nine elements of the vector.
It shall be 1:(split_number-1). But this also makes your split_number miss by one. 

    e <- input_list[c(1:split_number-1)]

 Below is correct code to create vector e with length split_number.

    e <- input_list[1:split_number]
    s <- input_list[(split_number+1):N]

Rest is fine. Minor mistake.

# A2.2 Bond Schedule:

Good

# A2.3 Stock data:

Good handling of error code

# A3.1 Bank data analysis
# A4.1 Bank data analysis

- Well done. Good effort for producing the findings.

# A1 Shiny Web

- Good.

# A2.1 Secretary

- Good with a testing code.


# A2.2 Bond Schedule

- Wrong intepretation of the problem:
  Tenor input becomes the interval of coupons. For 3 in tenor, it prints schdule table with 2023, 2026, ..., 2050.
  It should be the length of bond duration. For 3 in tenor, it means bond shall mature by 2023.


# A3.1 Bank data analysis
# A4.1 Bank data analysis

- Well done. Good effort for producing the findings.


# A4.3 Portfolio

The data for "S&P500" stops at 2020-04-01.

df_500 <- av_get("S&P500",av_fun = "TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED",outputsize="compact")

This timeseries has been recycled here. That's why there is no error in filling a longer dataframe with a shorter sequence.
As a result, your figure has a sharp drop in the middle.

  mutate(val_TSLA = no_t0*TSLA, val_AAPL = no_a0*AAPL, val_MSFT = no_m0*MSFT, val_EBAY = no_e0*EBAY,
         val_SP500 = no_s0*SP500) %>%

Correction: Replace the ticker with SPY

df_500 <- av_get("SPY",av_fun = "TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED",outputsize="compact")

There is difference between index and tradeable. The tradeable for S&P500 index is SPY ETF. There are many ETF for S&P. SPY is the most popular one.

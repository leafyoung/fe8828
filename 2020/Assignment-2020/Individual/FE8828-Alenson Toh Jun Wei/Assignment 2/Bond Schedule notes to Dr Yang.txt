Hi Dr Yang,

For the Bond Schedule, I have taken weekends into consideration, payment schedule that falls on weekends will be paid on
the Friday before. For example, if coupon payment falls on 3rd or 4th October 2020 (Saturday/Sunday), the coupon payment
will be on 2nd October 2020 instead (Friday). Thank you!

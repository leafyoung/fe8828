The three basic stages of a typical computational empirical research project are:
•data gathering,
•data analysis,
•results presentation.


+ Propose alternative strategy:
    + Re-balance portfolio on 21st, 41st, 61st, 81st and 100th day. Repeat the strategy analysis. Re-balance means to keep the weight still equal.
    + Hint: create functions for the plot, reduce the code-copying.

Simple trading strategy
The investment universe consists of 5 ETFs (SPY – US stocks, EFA – foreign stocks, BND – bonds, VNQ – REITs, GSG – commodities). Pick 3 ETFs with the strongest 12-month momentum into your portfolio and weight them equally. Hold for one month and then rebalance.
Hedge for stocks during bear markets
Partially - Tactical asset allocation strategy like the one proposed by Mebane Faber in his famous paper “A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation” usually contains equity-like risk assets, and the TAA strategy tries to rotate out of them during the time of stress. Therefore the proposed strategy isn’t mainly used as an add-on to a portfolio to hedge equity risk directly. Still, it is more an overlay that can be used to manage the percentual representation of equities (or “equity-like assets”) in a portfolio. The tactical asset allocation framework can decrease the overall risk of equities in a portfolio, and it can improve the risk-adjusted returns.

- Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to present simple quantitative methods that improve risk-adjusted returns for investing in US equity sectors and global asset class portfolios. A relative strength model is tested on the French-Fama US equity sector data back to the 1920s that results in increased absolute returns with equity-like risk. The relative strength portfolios outperform the buy and hold benchmark in approximately 70% of all years and returns are persistent across time. The addition of a trend-following parameter to dynamically hedge the portfolio decreases both volatility and drawdown. The relative strength model is then tested across a portfolio of global asset classes with supporting results.

Jegadeesh, N., & Titman, S. (1993). Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency. The Journal of Finance, 48(1), 65-91.

Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) 选择了过去 J 月的股票累计收益作为排序指标，并按照标准的因子构造方式来定义动量策略： f(J, K, L)，其中， J 为信号形成期长度， K 为持有期长度，而 L 为交易滞后期长度。具体操作如下：



每隔 K 月的月末，依据过去 J 月的股票累计收益排序，将股票分为 10 组；

等权重买入累计收益最高的一组，同时卖空累计收益最低一组的等权组合，并持有 K 个月。

K 月后重新筛选股票，构建新的组合。

此外，L 则是为了保障研究结果贴近真实交易结果而加入的交易时滞， Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) 设定为 L = 0.25，即在每月末生成新的交易信号后，延迟一周执行。

- Total volatility

- Beta

cov(r_i, r_m) \over var(r_m)

- Downside beta

另一方面，Vliet and Koning (2017) 一书则创造性地将低波动和动量与价值因子三者结合，构建了一个表现非常优异的投资策略。他们的方法也很简单，首先按照波动率从低到高排序，选出波动率较低的一半股票。然后，对选出的股票，计算其动量和价值得分并排序，将两项排名加总作为总分，并据此筛选出一定数量的股票（例如，仍然是 10% 的比例）。这样构建的股票组合，比单纯的低波动组合或者动量组合，表现都要优异很多。以美国市场1929年以来的表现为例，该策略的复合收益是单纯低波动组合的 54 倍， amazing !

Compared to trading other financial instruments, cryptocurrencies are a lot more volatile. Crypto Markets are also inefficient. Absence of central clearing authority leads to difference in prices across different exchanges. An example of this is the recent Binance hack where hackers withdrew 7000 BTC via a single transaction. Following this, BTC was trading close to 3% lower on Binance compared to other exchanges.

### Talk of the town ###

The talk of the town is the Bitcoin Halving expected to happen in May 2020.Bitcoin halving is the process by which block reward to miners is halved every 4 years. The block reward halving tends to have long-term positive effects on the price of bitcoin. Why does this happen? There are a lot of theories, but one common one comes down to simple supply and demand: If fewer bitcoins are being generated, the newly increased scarcity automatically makes them more valuable. But this doesn’t happen right away.

For a more nuanced explanation of why halvings correlate with eventual price changes, one needs to examine the role of miners. On average, 4,380 blocks are mined each month and added to the bitcoin blockchain. As of this writing, the block reward is 12.5 BTC with a price of around \$5,000, which I’ll use for this example. Crunching the numbers shows that 4,380 x 12.5 x 5,000 = $273,750,000 per month. This is approximately how much in dollars miners are earning each month in total revenue.

After the next halving, only half as many BTC will be generated per day. (4,380 x 6.25 x 5,000 = \$ 136,875,000 per month). When this occurs, one of two things will happen: Miners will simply give up, or they will refuse to sell bitcoins generated at a price below $10,000 (otherwise known as “HODLing”).
There is a clear correlation between bitcoin reward halving and price volatility afterward. These supply side changes happen every 4 years, and keeping that in mind can help build a better picture of what influences the price of bitcoin at different times.

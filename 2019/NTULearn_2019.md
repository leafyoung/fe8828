# Welcome to the course site of FE8828!

You could be wondering "why I shall take this course? It's mini term 2 and I am going to spend one credit in elective choices."

Let me start by explaining what's this course is about.

    * Programming is a practice of theory: : Theory <-> Programming <-> Practices
    * Data science: Data -> Model -> Application
    * Finance: Data -> Valuation Engine/Trading Engine -> Appplication 
    * In the world of Internet

- It shall provide you a practical sense of how programming is applied in real world.
- It still boils down to you to practice.
- Mind your own pace of learning.
- Per week, plan 2-3 hours to review and another 1-2 hours to complete the assignment.

R is a simple language and ready-to-work language. I encourage you to take on this course as a very cost-effective way to immerse into data and programming.

Adding FE8828 is perhaps a good mix with other "theory" subjects.

# Who am I?

Dear students,

I was a graduate from Mechatronics from Mechanical Engineering; I went on studying computational and structural biology, till marking it with PhD and started an interest in simulation and statistical physics. Rest is history is "stochastic motion" in this financial world.

I like working, outdoor sports, and cooking with pans and fire.
